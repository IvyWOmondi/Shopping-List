### **Project Overview**
This is a shopping list. I would like it to have a budget section that tracks expenditure, and a wish list. It is winforms app that has code, written by CoPilot, that saves the items on the list to a Txt file.
### **Features**
It has visual elements that compliment its design, and some that serve functionally. 
### **File Structure**
It has a few files, some that have the code, and others that focus on the design structure.
### **Installation Instructions**
???Probably download from an app store...idk
### **API Usage Details**
N/A
### **How Data is Stored**
Data is stored through a Txt file. Hopefully the saved data will have its own template and format.
### **Known Issues/Limitations**
Although it is available in a checklist list form, the 'checks' are not meaningful to the program. There is no way to track quanities,and totals.
### **Debugging Summary**
While in Visual Studio, press the 'start with debugging button' to debug the program. It is the one with a green filled triangle. Additionally you may also press F5, or click debug on the top of the page. 
### **Credits and acknowledgements**
CoPilot had a significant role to play in the making of this. LinkedIn Learning provided very useful guidance througout the way. Professor Norman was clear about the projects requirements, gave freedom coupled with guidance to see the project through.
