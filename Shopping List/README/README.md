- ## **Project Overview**
This is a simple shopping list that keeps track of items. It uses a WinForms app and code by CoPilot. 
- ## **Features**
It works by inputting and deleting items on a list via elements on WinForms, then saves the items on the list to a *.txt file*. It also features functional visual elements, and a few that complement its design. 
- ## **File Structure**
It has dependencies and three major folders, namely, properties, git, and README. It also has the source files Form 1.cs and Program.cs. The dependencies contain analyzers and frameworks. The properties folder stores the resource files. Git has .gitattributes, and .gitignore files. README.md is located in the README folder. Form 1.cs contains the designer and the code to fulfill it. Finaly, program.cs serves as the main entry point for this app. 
- ## **Installation Instructions**
Download through release on https://github.com/IvyWOmondi/Shopping-List.git.
- ## **API Usage Details**
N/A
- ## **How Data is Stored**
Data is stored in a *.txt file* which can be opened via the notebook app.  
- ## **Known Issues/Limitations**
Although it is available in a checklist form, the program just keeps track of items, rendering the checks meaningless once the list is saved.
- ## **Debugging Summary**
While in Visual Studio, press the *start with debugging button* to debug the program; it is the one with a green-filled triangle. Additionally, you may also press F5 or click debug at the top of the page.
